*Completionist - an Open Source C++ Autocomplete Engine*

## Features

### ðŸ¤– Self-building  
Completionist adds terms on-the-fly, updating the phrase data in the background and periodically replacing the old phrase data.

### âš¡ Lightning Fast
Written in C++, the intensive tasks of sorting, searching and ranking results are kept low-level, resulting in completions in only a handful of Î¼-seconds

### ðŸ’¾ Memory Efficient
By taking a memory-first approach to suggestions, Completionist removes infrequent suggestions when required to keep within memory limits.
